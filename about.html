            <p>For centuries, people have created time capsules to preserve moments in history—letters, photographs, and treasured items buried or locked away to be discovered by future generations. These capsules serve as a bridge between the past and the future, capturing emotions, aspirations, and milestones that might otherwise be forgotten. Inspired by this tradition, Time Capsule – A Digital Memory Vault brings the concept into the modern era, allowing users to store their memories securely in a digital format, accessible only when the chosen time arrives.</p>
            <p>Through this platform, users can set future dates for their memories to resurface, creating meaningful moments of reflection and surprise. Imagine opening a heartfelt letter from your younger self or receiving a note from a loved one who wanted to leave behind something special. Time Capsule – A Digital Memory Vault transforms memory preservation into a seamless, futuristic experience, ensuring that the essence of time capsules lives on in the digital age.</p>
